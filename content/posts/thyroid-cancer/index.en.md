Our company organizes annual routine physical examination a month ago(June, 2020), There are some tiny issue as in previous years, I didn't care too much. But there's something different this year, the nurse told me that I had thyroid nodules when doing color Doppler ultrasound, never found before.

The report came out after one week, the nodules are benign and do not need to be treated, regular review is enough. One more tiny issue, it should not a big problem, But for insurance, I decided to go to the hospital for a review. After the doctor checked my report, the doctor suggested that I come back for a review after three months, but I still worried at the time and asked to review it immediately.

## Diagnose

On the second day of color Doppler ultrasound, the nurse in hospital was more serious this time. After many times of check, the nurse's expression and tone became a little dignified, there's a tumors, irregular edges, and a volume of 6x5x5mm. I was transferred to ultrasound intervention on the same day. Make an appointment three days later for puncture. At this point, I feels a bit serious. Generally speaking, it can be observed by color Doppler ultrasound if it is benign. If puncture is required, it is probably malignant.

Three days later, the puncture was not as painful as expected. After the anesthetic, a needle is inserted through the throat and get  tissue cells from the tumor, no pain during the whole puncture, but the feeling of the needle slashing the cells in the throat can be very uncomfortable, and the sound of slashing things can make you a little headache.

Three days later, the result shows the tumor  is malignant, it's human papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Fortunately, it is still very early and has not metastasized to the lymph. The doctor recommends surgery to remove half of the thyroid gland to avoid further deterioration of the metastasis.

However, the hospital’s beds are tight and I need to wait for one to two weeks. After leaving my phone number, I waited for the hospital to call me while I was at work. After more than a week, the hospital still didn’t call me. I called the hospital to inquire about the progress. I was a little anxious and registered another hospital. This hospital arranged for the next day of hospitalization and surgery next week.

## Surgery

住院前几天除了做了一些常规的术前检查，其他时间和平常一样活蹦乱跳，还抽空爬了医院旁边的一座小山。手术前一天医生会进行术前谈话，告知手术方案、手术风险、特殊费用之类的，然后签风险告知书。手术前一晚10点钟以后不能进食进水，护士也会在手术提前一天通知注意事项。

手术当天，我是安排的当天第一台手术，7点半的时候护士就把我们带到了手术楼层，在进入手术室之前做了一些身份信息的确认，然后坐上轮椅，推到手术室门口前等待。等了大概十几分钟，推进了手术室，脱掉上衣，换上手术服，头向后仰平躺在手术台上。麻醉师又做了一次确认，插入针管，带上氧气面罩，麻醉师轻轻的说开始睡觉咯，麻醉师开始向针管推入麻醉药剂，不到十秒钟的时间我就渐渐失去知觉。

醒来的时候我模模糊糊听到有人喊我的名字，让我确认我叫什么名字，当时神智不清，艰难的说了自己的名字，感觉是有人围着把我往病房推。当我意识稍微清醒一点的时候我已经躺在病床上了，想着要发消息报平安，当时就拿手机乱按了一通，然后又睡着了。

## 术后恢复

手术第一天由于麻醉的影响，会昏昏沉沉，甚至有些头痛，吞咽会有些困难，医院会打一些葡萄糖点滴，手术6小时以后才能吃一些流食，喝一点水，没办法下床（要提前准备好尿壶）。

第二天麻醉完全散去，这时候吞咽就会明显感觉到喉咙痛，每次吞咽唾液都很困难，吃东西也只能吃一些软的东西，稀饭、香蕉、葡萄之类的。这时可以自己下床上厕所，自己活动下。

第三天喉咙会稍微好一点，吞咽不再那么困难，可以吃点饭。

第四、第五天的时候恢复得差不多了，这时候已经可以正常饮食，吞咽不再疼痛，只是会有一些异物感，但是咳嗽、打喷嚏的时候还是要注意。医院也会安排拔掉导流管，准备出院。
