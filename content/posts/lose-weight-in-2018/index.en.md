In 2018, I finally made up my mind to lose my weight. In more than half a year (seven months), I lost about 36 kilograms, from a fat man of 166 kilograms to 130 kilograms now. The indicators have reached normal. In fact, losing weight is not as difficult as imagined. The important thing is to persist. Summarizing the weight loss experience in the second half of the year, I mainly achieved the following aspects

## Exercise

The most part of exercise is running. In 7 months, I ran more than 700 kilometers, and then I also workout with keep, and walked 4 to 5 kilometers on occasion.

### Running

Running is a process of suffering to enjoyment ðŸ˜‚. At the beginning, I panted and dizzy when I ran just 1 kilometer. But at the beginning, I was determined and forced myself to run a distance of 4 to 5 kilometers. running and walking at the same time, with a pace of more than 8 minutes ðŸ¤£, and run for a few days without rest. The result is that the calf strikes, and it hurts when I run. I can only rest for two days. After running several times, the calf still hurts. After repeating this a few times, I realized that there was a problem with my running posture. I could not directly exert force on my calf, but force my thigh to drive my calf.

After correcting my running posture, the distance I ran each time reached 4 kilometers, and then 6 kilometers. Two months later, I ran the first 10 kilometers at a pace of 6 minutes and 28 seconds. Three months later, one evening, in November, I was in good condition and ran the farthest distance so far, 20 kilometers with a pace of 6 minutes and 11 seconds. Up to now, I can easily run 10 kilometers, with a pace of about 5 and a half to 6 minutes.

### workout

I donâ€™t have much time to workout. Weight loss basically relies on aerobic exercise. I will follow Keep exercising in the morning or an hour after dinner. The exercise time is between one hour and one and a half hours. Now even though I lose weight, my body sharp is not good , So now the intensity of running is also reduced and more time is spent on fitness exercises.

### Fast walk

Running is time-consuming, and you may not have so much energy and time to run during workdays, so in order to save time, commuting to get off work has been changed to walking. Basically, I walk fast, with a pace of about 9 minutes to 10 minutes. In this way, 400-500 kcal can be consumed for commuting.

### Equipment and equipment used in exercise

- iPhone X (I took my phone when I started running, but now I basically only take my Apple Watch for running)
- Apple Watch Series 3 GPS (It's very easy to use, the usual training plan and progress are all on it)
- AirPods (Running with music is more motivated)
- Xiaomi Body Fat Scale (Detect various body indexes)
- ASICS GEL-NIMBUS 20 (The only running shoe)
- Decathlon running shorts, T-shirt(Two sets)
- Yoga mat
- A pair of dumbbells(5KG)

### Software and services used in exercise

- Keep (Subscribed)
- Joyrun (Deprecated)
- Nike Run Club (Deprecated)
- xiaomi health

## Diet

In terms of diet, it is nothing more than to exercise moderation and calculate the approximate calorie intake per day. In the case of ensuring that you are not too hungry, try to create a large heat gap, so that the exercise will have a better effect. I just started to lose weight and did not exercise a lot. By eating a small bowl of rice at each meal, drinking a glass of water before meals, and not drinking beverages, I lost about 5 kilograms in one month.

Follow several principles in the usual diet, reduce carbohydrates, increase protein intake, and try to avoid large amounts of sugar intake, such as quitting drinks, desserts, juices, and cakes. Reduce fat intake.

### Breakfast

As the first meal at the beginning of the day, breakfast can be enriched. I usually have two boiled eggs, two slices of toast (whole wheat), and a cup of milk (skim). The calories are about 400 kcal.

### Lunch

Lunch should provide calories for work in the afternoon, so this meal does not need to be too modest, just eat it normally, avoid high-sugar and high-fat foods, and control the calories at about 400 to 500 calories.

### Dinner

Dinner is the key of weight loss, because after dinner, there is basically no activity that consumes a lot of calories. At this time, the calorie intake should be strictly controlled, if it is during the weight loss period. It is recommended to avoid carbohydrate intake and change to protein, which makes it more hungry. The calorie is controlled at 300 to 400 kcal, so that the daily intake is around 1200 kcal.

If you are really hungry in the middle of the night, you can use melons and fruits to satisfy your hunger, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, oranges, apples and various fruits (I like tomatoes, so I always have tomatoes at home).
