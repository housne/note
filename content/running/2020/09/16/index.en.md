I went to the hospital for the first postoperative review this morning, Check the thyroid hormone level, the doctor will adjust the dose of yourigale according to the results. And I also asked the doctor that can I start exercising? "Of course, exercise in moderation is beneficial to recovery", said by the doctor. So I decided to do a short running  this evening.
